#### Update: this is now under the [tenbysix tag](/tags/ten-by-six)

A while back I read [this blog post about the 100:10:1 method]
(http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/).
It sounded like a pretty neat idea.

A bit later, [a friend](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/535) posted his ideas,
and I decided to jump on that bandwagon.

I sat down and wrote the 100 ideas, then decided to order them by general theme.
Later, I'll break this down to just 10 to prototype.
