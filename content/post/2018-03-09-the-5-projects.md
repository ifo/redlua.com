This is a continuation of my [current 25-5 project](/post/starting-25-5), which
you can follow with the [25:5 tag](/tags/25-5/).

## So the 5

Of the options I had last time, I decided to select these:

* an arbitrary json api for testing
* https.quine.space - https written in Go
* kubernetes raspberrypi cluster
* bott pilgrim - a twitter bot that quotes Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
* a redis hosting site

I also mentioned that I'd already completed two of them.
Those two are the first two listed above - the arbitrary json api for use with
testing, and the https in Go, which you can currently see at
[https.quine.space](https://https.quine.space).
I'll have a write-up on those soon.

## So why those 5?

Each of these options touches part of my present interest in backend and systems
development.
They also touch various different current interests of mine:

- Integration style testing
- TLS and how it even works (which I still don't know)
- Distributed systems that expect and account for failure
- Bots... And Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, obviously
- Systems designed for ease of use of other systems (so any sort of "hosted
  software as a service" kind of thing)

So I'm really excited to be working on them.

### An Additional Note

A major part of the goal of making 5 separate projects (as opposed to just one),
is learning what gives that 80% of the functionality, using only 20% of the
effort to finish it.

Because I'm trying to err on the side of incompleteness this time, some of these
are going to be _extremely_ minimal in their "final" forms.
So, though I'll consider these projects complete, they might be anything but
usable by anyone other than myself.

So yeah, just a little bit of warning about the level of completeness you should
expect from any of them.
