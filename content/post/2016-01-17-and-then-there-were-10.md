Previously, I started the [100:10:1 method](http://redlua.com/post/100-10-1/)
for choosing projects.
Now it's time to choose 10 and start prototyping.

The idea is to get these 10 prototypes done in 6 months.
That's a prototype completion every 18.26 days.
To help me keep on track, [@icco](https://twitter.com/icco) and I are going to
have weekly checkins (it might help him too, who knows).

So here are the 10 I've chosen:

- dogetipbot for zulip or maybe slack
- scott pilgrim vs the world twitter bot
- a photo management website
- a dota2 api collector / analyzer site
- a redis hosting website
- a twitter snowflake clone for random strings
- b2 api library (backblaze)
- a reverse terminal for presentations
- (website) an artisinal http response website
- noli (lisp with no parens)

I may implement some of the smaller and easier ideas (e.g. letter api) for fun,
but that won't specifically be a part of this project.

There were also a couple of ideas that were REALLY close to making the short
list, but in the end they were either too complicated or too related to another
idea to make it.
I may make these in the future, but for now I'll do related things to learn the
pieces I don't yet know.

### Too complicated

- dogemail (email where you have to pay doge to the recipient to reduce spam)
- three factor authentication
- a sneeze tracking website (I sneeze so much this would have complicated scalability issues)

### Too similar

- exif data inserter
